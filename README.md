# Mission to Mars

Purpose:
In this challenge we made an app! Our app scrapes articles, images and data from the web and compiles them in an app that updates the latest data including News articles. 

## Style Changes

I chose to change the scrape button to be green and darken when the button is clicked to tell the user that the button has been pressed and is loading the new data from the web. Second, I played around with image formats and changed the borders on my scraped mars images to be round.
